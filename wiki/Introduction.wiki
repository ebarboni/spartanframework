THIS IS SPARTAn framework!!!

= Introduction =

_The following wiki is based on version 1.0 of the spartan framework._

==A bit of history to begin with...==

When I first began doing small games, I reached a state where I was doing the same things over and over again, so a framework of sorts started to appear.
Later on I read about component based systems and implemented the first fully workingframework called Corporeal... oh boy was that a failure. As I was told (by Appel) in the Slick2d forums, the whole system was bloated. Updates and renders were called even if the component had no render or updates to be made. So back to the drawing board.

After reading lots of documentation I began my work on the new framework, a full blown entity based framework to help in the making of games. And so spartan was born...
